Hi there! I am a research engineer with a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering, working on structural mechanics/structural health monitoring. Without a degree in CS, I managed to acquire abundant CS knowledge and made myself acquaint with skills in compiling/installing open-source codes. 

When I was learning these, I really wish that out there there is a site hosting tutorials/knowledge about general open-source knowledge, and mostly importantly, how to solve issues that always unexpectedly popup during compiling. So I started this site around October 2018 for the purpose to make lives easier for beginners to embark on the open-source journey.
